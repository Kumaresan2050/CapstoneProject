** Methodology
In this project, I will use the basic methodology as taught in Week 3 lab.

Above, we have done convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values.
Then we will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in both cities, Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru
After that, explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood,
and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters
K-means clustering algorithm will be use to complete this task. And also, the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru and their emerging clusters.

Based on dataframe analysis above, we found out that Bukit Bintang area in Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru area in Johor Bahru are both have the highest number of area within it those district.
